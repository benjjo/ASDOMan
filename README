******************
** SETUP PYTHON **
******************

Install python 3.8 or better.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/
https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/python.html

Open a command line and run the following: python --version
You should see something like this:

C:\Users\Ben McGuffog>python --version
Python 3.8.6

C:\Users\Ben McGuffog>

If you get an error, or you see python version 2 installed then follow these instructions:

******************
**  RUN IP-MAN  **
******************
Once python is installed, just copy ASDOMan.py into a safe folder. ASDOMan.py will create a logs folder in the
folder that it is executed. If a folder already exists, ASDOMan will overwrite it. So use it at your own risk.

Set you static IP address to:
IP:   10.128.33.10
MASK: 255.224.0.0

Connect to the T2 port on the trainswitch and double click on ASDOMan.py. Let ASDOMan run to completion.
